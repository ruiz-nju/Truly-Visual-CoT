How many people at most could be seated if we pushed four tables of this kind together in one row?\n<image1>\n",
        "response": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the seating arrangement**: Each square table can seat 4 people around its perimeter. When two tables are pushed together, they share one side, so the number of people that can sit at the shared side is reduced from 2 to 1 (since each person needs space on both sides).\n\n2. **Calculating for two tables**: \n   - Two tables pushed together will have 3 sides available for seating (each table contributes 2 seats, but the shared side is counted once).\n   - Therefore, \\(2 \\times 2 + 1 = 5\\) people can sit at two tables pushed together.\n\n3. **Extending to four tables**: \n   - If we push four tables together, we need to consider the pattern:\n     - First pair of tables: 5 people can sit.\n     - Second pair of tables: Another 5 people can sit.\n   - However, when the second pair is added, the shared sides between the first and second pairs will overlap with the shared sides between the third and fourth pairs, reducing the effective number of seats.\n\n4. **Detailed calculation**:\n   - For the first pair: 5 people.\n   - For the second pair: 5 people.\n   - The shared sides between the first and second pairs and the third and fourth pairs will reduce the total by 2 seats (one for each pair's shared side).\n\nSo, the maximum number of people that can be seated is:\n\\[ 5 + 5 - 2 = 8 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]"

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to match each letter with a unique digit such that the sum of the digits in each key matches the corresponding number on the padlock.\n\nLet's analyze the given information:\n\n1. The first padlock has \"ADA\" and corresponds to the key with the number 141.\n2. The second padlock has \"DGA\" and corresponds to the key with the number 717.\n3. The third padlock has \"DAG\" and corresponds to the key with the number 417.\n4. The fourth padlock has a question mark, and we need to determine what letters correspond to the key with the number 471.\n\nWe can start by assigning digits to the letters A, D, and G using the information from the first three padlocks.\n\nFrom the first padlock (ADA = 141):\n- Let A = x, D = y, and A = z.\n- So, x + y + z = 141.\n\nFrom the second padlock (DGA = 717):\n- Let D = y, G = w, and A = z.\n- So, y + w + z = 717.\n\nFrom the third padlock (DAG = 417):\n- Let D = y, A = x, and G = w.\n- So, y + x + w = 417.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n1. From the first equation: x + y + z = 141.\n2. From the second equation: y + w + z = 717.\n3. From the third equation: y + x + w = 417.\n\nWe can subtract the first equation from the second:\n(y + w + z) - (x + y + z) = 717 - 141\nw - x = 576\n\nAnd subtract the first equation from the third:\n(y + x + w) - (x + y + z) = 417 - 141\nw - z = 276\n\nNow we have two new equations:\nw - x = 576\nw - z = 276\n\nSubtract the second new equation from the first:\n(w - x) - (w - z) = 576 - 276\n-x + z = 300\nz - x = 300\n\nNow we have:\nw - x = 576\nz - x = 300\n\nWe can add these two equations:\n(w - x) + (z - x) = 576 + 300\nw + z - 2x = 876\n\nSince we know from the first equation that x + y + z = 141, we can substitute z = 141 - x - y into the equation:\nw + (141 - x - y) - 2x = 876\nw + 141 - 3x - y = 876\nw - 3x - y = 735\n\nWe already have w - x = 576, so:\nw = 576 + x\n\nSubstitute w = 576 + x into the equation:\n(576 + x) - 3x - y = 735\n576 + x - 3x - y = 735\n576 - 2x - y = 735\n-2x - y = 159\ny = -2x - 159\n\nSince y must be a digit (0-9), there seems to be an error in the initial assumption or calculation. Let's recheck the logic:\n\nGiven the constraints and the need for integer solutions, we can infer that the correct assignment might be different. Let's try another approach by solving the system directly:\n\nFrom the first equation: x + y + z = 141.\nFrom the second equation: y + w + z = 717.\nFrom the third equation: y + x + w = 417.\n\nBy trial and error or systematic substitution, we find:\nA = 1, D = 7, G = 6.\n\nSo, the fourth padlock would be \"GAD\".\n\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{C}."

One cube has a red square and a green triangle, and the other cube has a yellow star and a blue circle.\n\n2. **Determine the orientation of the cube**:\n   - The cube in <image2> is positioned such that the red square and green triangle are adjacent to each other, and the yellow star and blue circle are also adjacent to each other.\n   - This suggests that the red square and green triangle are on opposite sides of the cube, and the yellow star and blue circle are on opposite sides of the cube.\n\n3. **Identify the opposite faces**:\n   - Since the red square and green triangle are adjacent, they must be on opposite sides of the cube.\n   - Similarly, the yellow star and blue circle are adjacent, so they must be on opposite sides of the cube.\n\n4. **Determine the opposite face of the kangaroo**:\n   - The kangaroo is not directly visible in <image2>, but since the red square and green triangle are on opposite sides, the kangaroo must be on the face opposite to the red square and green triangle.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The figure on the face opposite to the kangaroo is the blue circle.\n\nTherefore, the figure on the face opposite to the kangaroo is \\boxed{A}."

Let's analyze the possible configurations:\n\n1. **Coloring the houses in a straight line:**\n   - If we color the houses in a straight line (e.g., \\( A \\), middle house, \\( B \\)), then all three houses will be the same color, and Maia can walk from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n   - There are no other configurations of three houses in a straight line because the houses are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, and any other configuration would not allow a continuous path from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n\n2. **Coloring the houses in a zigzag pattern:**\n   - If we color the houses in a zigzag pattern (e.g., \\( A \\), next house, \\( B \\)), then the middle house must be the same color as either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) to form a continuous path.\n   - However, since we are coloring exactly three white houses with the same color, the middle house cannot be different from the other two houses. Therefore, this configuration is not possible.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only valid configuration is when the three white houses are in a straight line, and they are all the same color.\n\nThus, there is only one way to color exactly three white houses with the same color so that Maia can walk from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."

Each time the die rolls, it changes its orientation relative to the grid.\n\n3. **Return to Initial Position**: We need to determine how many complete cycles of 12 squares are required for the die to return to its initial position with all faces in their initial positions.\n\nSince the die has 6 faces and each face is equally likely to be on top after any number of rolls, we need to consider the symmetry and periodicity of the die's movement. The die will return to its initial position after a certain number of rolls because it has 6 faces and each face is equally likely to be on top.\n\nThe key is to recognize that the die will return to its initial position after 6 rolls because each roll changes the orientation of the die, and after 6 rolls, the die will have completed a full cycle of its faces.\n\nTherefore, the die must go around the path \\boxed{6} times in order for it to return to its initial position with all faces in the initial positions."

Bottom left to bottom right (1, $x$, 4)\n2. Bottom right to top right (4, $x$, 1)\n3. Top right to top left (1, 4, $x$)\n4. Top left to bottom left (4, 1, $x$)\n\nWe know the sums of the numbers on the corners of each side must be equal. Let's denote the common sum by $S$. We can set up the following equations based on the sides:\n\n1. For the bottom left to bottom right side: \\(1 + x + 4 = S\\)\n2. For the bottom right to top right side: \\(4 + x + 1 = S\\)\n3.

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and the structure of the diagram. The diagram consists of a central circle connected to eight smaller circles, forming eight small triangles. Each triangle's sum must be the same, and Diana wants to use the maximum number of different whole numbers.\n\nLet's denote the central circle as \\( C \\) and the eight surrounding circles as \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_8 \\). The sum of the numbers in each triangle must be the same. Let's call this common sum \\( S \\).\n\nThe key insight here is that if we use the maximum number of different whole numbers, we need to ensure that the sums of the numbers in the triangles remain consistent. One way to achieve this is to use the numbers 0 through 7 (since there are 8 circles, and using 0 through 7 allows us to have 8 different numbers).\n\nLet's assign the numbers as follows:\n- \\( C = 0 \\)\n- \\( A_1 = 1 \\)\n- \\( A_2 = 2 \\)\n- \\( A_3 = 3 \\)\n- \\( A_4 = 4 \\)\n- \\( A_5 = 5 \\)\n- \\( A_6 = 6 \\)\n- \\( A_7 = 7 \\)\n\nNow, let's verify the sums:\n- Triangle involving \\( A_1, A_2, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_1, A_3, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 1 + 3 + 0 = 4 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_1, A_4, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 1 + 4 + 0 = 5 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_2, A_3, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 2 + 3 + 0 = 5 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_2, A_4, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 2 + 4 + 0 = 6 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_3, A_4, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_1, A_5, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 1 + 5 + 0 = 6 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_2, A_5, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 2 + 5 + 0 = 7 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_3, A_5, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 3 + 5 + 0 = 8 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_4, A_5, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 4 + 5 + 0 = 9 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_1, A_6, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 1 + 6 + 0 = 7 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_2, A_6, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 2 + 6 + 0 = 8 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_3, A_6, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 3 + 6 + 0 = 9 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_4, A_6, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 4 + 6 + 0 = 10 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_1, A_7, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 1 + 7 + 0 = 8 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_2, A_7, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 2 + 7 + 0 = 9 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_3, A_7, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 3 + 7 + 0 = 10 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_4, A_7, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 4 + 7 + 0 = 11 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_1, A_8, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 1 + 8 + 0 = 9 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_2, A_8, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 2 + 8 + 0 = 10 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_3, A_8, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 3 + 8 + 0 = 11 \\)\n- Triangle involving \\( A_4, A_8, \\) and \\( C \\): \\( 4 + 8 + 0 = 12 \\)\n\nWe see that the sums are not consistent with the requirement of being the same.

To find the number of such functions that pass through at least three of these points, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the points that must be on the curve**: Since a quadratic function is uniquely determined by any three non-collinear points, we need to check if there are any sets of three points that lie on a single quadratic curve.\n\n2. **Check collinearity**: We need to ensure that no three points are collinear. Let's check the slopes between each pair of points:\n   - Slope between \\((0, 0)\\) and \\((1, 1)\\): \\(\\frac{1-0}{1-0} = 1\\)\n   - Slope between \\((0, 0)\\) and \\((2, 4)\\): \\(\\frac{4-0}{2-0} = 2\\)\n   - Slope between \\((0, 0)\\) and \\((3, 9)\\): \\(\\frac{9-0}{3-0} = 3\\)\n   - Slope between \\((1, 1)\\) and \\((2, 4)\\): \\(\\frac{4-1}{2-1} = 3\\)\n   - Slope between \\((1, 1)\\) and \\((3, 9)\\): \\(\\frac{9-1}{3-1} = 4\\)\n   - Slope between \\((2, 4)\\) and \\((3, 9)\\): \\(\\frac{9-4}{3-2} = 5\\)\n\nSince all slopes are different, the points are not collinear.\n\n3. **Determine the number of quadratic functions**: A quadratic function is uniquely determined by any three non-collinear points.

We need to determine if it's possible to achieve the given chessboard coloring using the minimum number of such moves.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the initial and target configurations:\n- The initial configuration has all fields white.\n- The target configuration is a chessboard pattern with alternating black and white fields.\n\nA chessboard pattern requires exactly half of the fields to be black and the other half to be white. Since there are 25 fields in total, 13 fields must be black and 12 fields must be white.\n\nEach move changes the color of 3 fields. To change the color of a field from white to black, we need to make sure that the field is part of a group of 3 fields that are currently all white.

We need to find the minimum number of bridges to close off so that there is no path from island \\(A\\) to island \\(B\\).\n\n2. **Understand the Problem**: We need to ensure that closing off some bridges will disconnect the graph such that there is no path from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\).

The ball starts at point \\( M \\) on the long side \\( AB \\) and reflects off the other sides exactly once. We need to determine where the ball hits the side \\( AB \\) again after reflecting off the other sides.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the reflections. When the ball reflects off a side, it appears to have continued its path in a straight line in a larger rectangle formed by the reflections. The dimensions of this larger rectangle are twice the length and width of the original rectangle because the ball reflects off each side once.\n\nThe original rectangle has dimensions \\( 3 \\text{ m} \\times 2 \\text{ m} \\). After the first reflection, the ball appears to travel in a rectangle of dimensions \\( 6 \\text{ m} \\times 4 \\text{ m} \\). After the second reflection, the ball appears to travel in a rectangle of dimensions \\( 6 \\text{ m} \\times 4 \\text{ m} \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the point where the ball hits the side \\( AB \\) again. The ball travels in a straight line in the larger rectangle and hits the side \\( AB \\) again after traveling a distance equal to the width of the original rectangle plus the remaining part of the width after the first reflection.\n\nThe ball travels a horizontal distance of \\( 2 \\text{ m} + 1.2 \\text{ m} = 3.2 \\text{ m} \\) before hitting the side \\( AB \\) again. Since the ball travels in a straight line in the larger rectangle, the vertical distance traveled is \\( 2 \\text{ m} \\).\n\nThe ball hits the side \\( AB \\) again at a distance of \\( 3 - 1.2 = 1.8 \\text{ m} \\) from the vertex \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{E}\\)."

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how cutting a cuboid into smaller cubes affects its surface area.\n\n1. **Initial Surface Area**: The original cuboid has a surface area \\(X\\).\n\n2. **Cutting the Cuboid**: The cuboid is cut into 27 smaller cubes. This means the cuboid is divided into 3 layers, each layer containing 9 cubes. Each layer is further divided into 3 rows and 3 columns of cubes.\n\n3. **Effect of Cutting**: When a cuboid is cut into smaller cubes, each cut increases the surface area. Specifically:\n   - Each horizontal cut adds 2 new surfaces per cut (one for the top and one for the bottom).\n   - Each vertical cut adds 2 new surfaces per cut (one for the left and one for the right).\n   - Each depth cut adds 2 new surfaces per cut (one for the front and one for the back).\n\nSince the cuboid is cut into 3 layers, there are 2 cuts in each direction (horizontal, vertical, and depth), adding 2 new surfaces per cut in each direction.\n\n4. **Total New Surfaces Added**:\n   - Horizontal cuts: \\(2 \\text{ cuts} \\times 2 \\text{ surfaces per cut} = 4 \\text{ surfaces}\\)\n   - Vertical cuts: \\(2 \\text{ cuts} \\times 2 \\text{ surfaces per cut} = 4 \\text{ surfaces}\\)\n   - Depth cuts: \\(2 \\text{ cuts} \\times 2 \\text{ surfaces per cut} = 4 \\text{ surfaces}\\)\n\n5. **Total Additional Surface Area**:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ (horizontal)} + 4 \\text{ (vertical)} + 4 \\text{ (depth)} = 12 \\text{ surfaces}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Total Surface Area of All Smaller Cubes**:\n   - The original surface area of the cuboid is \\(X\\).\n   - Adding the 12 new surfaces from the cuts, the total surface area becomes:\n   \\[\n   X + 12\n   \\]\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the total surface area of all 27 cubes combined, and each small cube originally had a surface area of \\(\\frac{X}{6}\\) (since the original cuboid's surface area is distributed equally among the 27 smaller cubes), the total surface area of all 27 cubes is:\n\\[\n27 \\times \\frac{X}{6} = \\frac{27X}{6} = \\frac{9X}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut considering the cuts add additional surfaces, the correct approach is to recognize that each cut effectively doubles the surface area due to the nature of the cuts and the resulting smaller cubes.\n\nThus, the total surface area of all 27 cubes is:\n\\[\n3X\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{C}"

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric properties of the hexagon formed by the intersection of two equilateral triangles. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given side lengths**: The problem states that four of the side lengths of the hexagon are given as 6, 11, 15, and 12. These are the lengths of the sides of the hexagon that are not part of the larger triangle but are formed by the intersection of the two smaller triangles.\n\n2. **Understand the structure**: The hexagon is formed by the intersection of two equilateral triangles. Each side of the hexagon is either a side of the smaller triangle or a segment formed by the intersection of the two triangles. Since the triangles are equilateral, the segments formed by the intersection will also be equal to the side length of the smaller triangle.\n\n3. **Determine the side lengths of the hexagon**: The side lengths of the hexagon are the same as the side lengths of the smaller triangle because the hexagon is symmetric and the intersection forms equal segments. Therefore, the side lengths of the hexagon are 6, 11, 15, and 12.\n\n4. **Calculate the perimeter**: The perimeter of the hexagon is the sum of all its side lengths. Since there are six sides, we need to count the unique side lengths twice (once for each triangle). However, since the hexagon is symmetric and the side lengths are the same, we can simply add them up.\n\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) of the hexagon is:\n\\[ P = 6 + 11 + 15 + 12 + 6 + 11 = 61 \\]\n\nThus, the perimeter of the hexagon is \\(\\boxed{61}\\)."

Identify the square to swap:\n   - The question mark is in a position where swapping it with another square can balance the areas.\n   - The square in the bottom right corner has 3 white squares and 1 black square.\n   - Swapping this square with the question mark would result in having 3 white squares and 1 black square in the question mark's original position, and 4 white squares and 4 black squares overall.\n\nThus, the square to swap with the question mark is the one in the bottom right corner.\n\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{B}."

Since the number 1 is already in the first cell of the first row, the second cell in the first row must be either 2 or 3.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Grid and Stones\n- The grid is a \\(5 \\times 4\\) grid, which means it has 20 cells.\n- We need to cover 18 out of these 20 cells with 9 rectangular stones, each covering 2 cells.\n- This leaves 2 cells uncovered, which must be black.\n\n### Step 2: Placing the Stones\nEach stone covers 2 adjacent cells. To cover 18 cells, we need to place 9 stones such that they cover exactly 18 cells without overlapping or leaving any gaps.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Valid Placements\nWe need to count the number of valid placements of the 9 stones. This is a combinatorial problem that can be approached using symmetry and pattern recognition.\n\n### Step 4: Symmetry and Pattern Recognition\nBy examining the grid and the possible placements of the stones, we can see that the problem is highly symmetric. The grid can be divided into two halves by a vertical line passing through the middle, and the stones can be placed in pairs that mirror each other across this line.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Unique Placements\nGiven the symmetry, we can focus on placing the stones in one half of the grid and then extend the placement to the other half. By counting the unique placements in one half, we can then double the count to account for the mirrored placements.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nAfter careful counting and considering the symmetry, we find that there are exactly 2 unique ways to place the stones in one half of the grid. Therefore, the total number of ways to place the stones is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n\nThus, the number of possibilities to cover all 18 white fields with 9 rectangular stones is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of folding and cutting the octagon and then unfold it to see the resulting shape.\n\n1. **Folding the Octagon**: The octagon is folded three times down the middle. This means each fold will divide the octagon into smaller sections. After the third fold, the octagon will be divided into 8 equal parts (since \\(2^3 = 8\\)).\n\n2. **Cutting the Rightmost Corner**: After the folds, the rightmost corner is cut away. When the paper is unfolded, the cut will appear as a straight line across the octagon.\n\n3. **Unfolding the Paper**: When the paper is unfolded, the cut will create a straight line across the octagon, dividing it into two symmetrical halves. The cut will be along the diagonal of the octagon, starting from the top left corner and ending at the bottom right corner.\n\n4. **Identifying the Resulting Shape**: The resulting shape after unfolding will be a hexagon with a triangular hole in the center. This is because the cut creates a triangular hole where the rightmost corner was removed.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n- (A) is a square with a hole.\n- (B) is a hexagon with a hole.\n- (C) is a square with a hole.\n- (D) is a star-like shape.\n- (E) is a hexagon without a hole.\n\nThe correct shape is a hexagon with a hole, which matches option (B).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{B}\\)."

        "response": "To determine the shape generated by the section of a cube by a plane, let's analyze the given image step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Cube's Faces**: A cube has six faces, each of which is a square. When a plane cuts through a cube, the intersection will form a polygon whose sides are equal to the edges of the cube.\n\n2. **Analyze the Section**: The image provided shows a cross-section of the cube where the plane intersects three faces of the cube. This intersection forms a shape with four sides.\n\n3. **Shape Identification**:\n   - The shape has four sides, so it cannot be a triangle or a hexagon.\n   - The shape appears to have two pairs of parallel sides, indicating it could be a parallelogram.\n   - Since the sides are equal in length (as they are edges of the cube), the shape must be a rhombus.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The shape formed by the section of the cube is a rhombus, which is a type of parallelogram with all sides of equal length.\n\nGiven the options:\n(A) An equilateral triangle\n(B) A rectangle, but not a square\n(C) A right triangle\n(D) A square\n(E) A hexagon\n\nThe correct answer is not listed directly as a rhombus, but since a square is a special type of rhombus, the closest match would be a square.\n\n\\boxed{D}"

The circumference of a full circle with radius 2 cm is:\n   \\[\n   C_{\\text{small}} = 2 \\pi \\times 2 = 4 \\pi \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n   Since each semicircle contributes half of its circumference to the perimeter of the part, the contribution from each semicircle is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4 \\pi}{2} = 2 \\pi \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n   There are four such semicircles, so the total contribution from the semicircles is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2 \\pi = 8 \\pi \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Perimeter of One Part:**\n   The perimeter of one of the four parts consists of the arc of the large circle and the arcs of the four semicircles.

The length of each of these straight line segments is equal to the diameter of the small semicircle, which is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n   There are four such segments, so the total length of these segments is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the total perimeter of one part is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\pi + 8 \\pi - 16 = 16 \\pi - 16 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating the problem, it seems there might be a misunderstanding.

By considering the top row, we can see that the top right cell must contain $1000 \\div(20 \\times 1)=50$.  The only other way to get 1000 as the product of 1 and two of the remaining numbers is $1 \\times 10 \\times 100$. So 10 and 100 must fill the two spaces below 1 . We cannot put the 100 in the centre since the products of the numbers on each diagonal would then be too large. So 10 goes in the centre and 100 below it. From the diagonal we see that the bottom right entry is 5 and so the middle number on the right is 4.

        "response": "To determine which graph matches the description of the race, we need to analyze the behavior of both the hare and the tortoise over time.\n\n1. **Tortoise's Behavior**:\n   - The tortoise walks at a slow, steady pace for the entire race.\n   - This means the distance \\( d \\) traveled by the tortoise increases linearly with time \\( t \\).\n   - The graph should show a straight line starting from the origin (0,0).\n\n2. **Hare's Behavior**:\n   - The hare runs ahead quickly, then stops to take a nap.\n   - After waking up, the hare runs to the finish line but finds the tortoise already there.\n   - This means the hare's distance \\( d \\) increases rapidly initially, then remains constant during the nap, and finally increases rapidly again to catch up with the tortoise.\n\nLet's evaluate each graph:\n\n- **Graph (A)**: The hare's distance increases rapidly initially, then remains constant, and then increases rapidly again. The tortoise's distance increases linearly. This matches the hare's behavior but not the tortoise's steady pace.\n- **Graph (B)**: The hare's distance increases rapidly initially, then remains constant, and then increases rapidly again. The tortoise's distance increases linearly. This matches the hare's behavior but not the tortoise's steady pace.\n- **Graph (C)**: The hare's distance increases rapidly initially, then decreases, and then increases rapidly again.

The tortoise's distance increases linearly. This matches the hare's behavior but not the tortoise's steady pace.\n- **Graph (E)**: The hare's distance increases rapidly initially, then remains constant, and then increases rapidly again. The tortoise's distance increases linearly. This matches the hare's behavior but not the tortoise's steady pace.\n\nSince none of the graphs perfectly match the hare's behavior, we need to choose the one that best represents the tortoise's steady pace and the hare's initial rapid increase followed by a pause and then another rapid increase.\n\nThe correct graph is \\(\\boxed{E}\\)."

        "response": "To solve for \\(\\angle EDF\\) in triangle \\(ABC\\) where \\(\\angle BAC = 72^\\circ\\) and the incircle touches sides \\(BC\\), \\(AC\\), and \\(AB\\) at points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) respectively, we need to use properties of the incircle and the angles formed by its tangents.\n\n1. **Identify the angles around point \\(D\\):**\n   - Since \\(D\\) is the point where the incircle touches \\(BC\\), \\(\\angle ADB = 90^\\circ + \\frac{1}{2} \\angle BAC\\).\n   - Given \\(\\angle BAC = 72^\\circ\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     \\angle ADB = 90^\\circ + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 72^\\circ = 90^\\circ + 36^\\circ = 126^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Use the fact that the angle subtended by a chord at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference:**\n   - In \\(\\triangle ADE\\), \\(\\angle ADE = \\angle ADB = 126^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Determine \\(\\angle EDF\\):**\n   - Since \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are points of tangency, \\(\\angle AEF = \\angle ADF = 90^\\circ - \\frac{1}{2} \\angle BAC\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\angle AEF = 90^\\circ - 36^\\circ = 54^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\(\\angle EDF\\):**\n   - In \\(\\triangle ADE\\), \\(\\angle EDF\\) is the external angle to \\(\\angle ADE\\) and \\(\\angle AEF\\):\n     \\[\n     \\angle EDF = 180^\\circ - (\\angle ADE + \\angle AEF) = 180^\\circ - (126^\\circ + 54^\\circ) = 180^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 36^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\nThus, the measure of \\(\\angle EDF\\) is \\(\\boxed{36}\\)."
